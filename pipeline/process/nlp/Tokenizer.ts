    We are currently using a simple regex-based tokenizer.
    It is not perfect, but it works for now. Its main disadvantage is that it
    only works for Latin-based and similar languages. We should probably use a more
    sophisticated tokenizer in the future.
    
    Citing fastText tokenizer:
    > We used the Stanford word segmenter for Chinese, Mecab for Japanese and
    > UETsegmenter for Vietnamese. For languages using the Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew
    > or Greek scripts, we used the tokenizer from the Europarl preprocessing tools.
    > For the remaining languages, we used the ICU tokenizer.
    > (source: https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html)
    Migrating these is a lot of work.
    I didn't find a good library for this, so we would have to implement it ourselves.
    Also I only know well Spanish and English, so I need help here.

    But we also have another problem, we don't know beforehand what language the
    messages are in. Asking the user may only work sometimes since people can be
    multilingual in the same conversation and servers may have different languages per channel.
    We could switch tokenizers based on the language of the message detected by fastText,
    but my tests showed that it is not very accurate. ðŸ˜”
